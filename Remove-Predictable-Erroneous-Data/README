Assignment Instructions:
------------------------
You are given data that has been through a "backup" program which, at times, added extraneous data.
This added data has a pattern: it ALWAYS starts with a CONTROL-C and ends in a CONTROL-B.
After the CONTROL-C, there may be more Control-C characters as part of the extraneous data.
Write programs in PERL, JAVA, and PYTHON which remove these values from the text file.
